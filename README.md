**CODING-O-BEAN**

Hi, I’m @Coding-o-Bean! I’m interested in making games and coding. I’m currently participating in Intro to software development. I’m looking to collaborate with my friends
to make a new survival card game. I'm new to coding but have learned a lot already. I will be using GitHub to Upload code for our game.
